# discord-i18n
An example of how to allow your bot to support multiple languages.

This is the system used by [Starboard-2](https://github.com/CircuitsBots/Starboard-2) which is based on [XuaTheGrate/i18n](https://github.com/XuaTheGrate/i18n)

This example supports localizing not only command responses, but command help, bot description, and cog description as well.
